<p>For optimal decision making under variable class distributions and 
misclassification costs a classifier needs to produce well-calibrated 
estimates of the posterior probability. Isotonic calibration is a 
powerful non-parametric method that is however prone to overfitting on 
smaller datasets; hence a parametric method based on the logistic curve 
is commonly used. While logistic calibration is designed to correct for a
 specific kind of distortion where classifiers tend to score on too 
narrow a scale, we demonstrate experimentally that many classifiers 
including naive Bayes and Adaboost suffer from the opposite distortion 
where scores tend too much to the extremes. In such cases logistic 
calibration can easily yield probability estimates that are worse than 
the original scores. Moreover, the logistic curve family does not 
include the identity function, and hence logistic calibration can easily
 uncalibrate a perfectly calibrated classifier.</p>

<p>In this paper we solve all these problems with a richer class of 
calibration maps based on the Beta distribution. We derive the method 
from first principles and show that fitting it is as easy as fitting a 
logistic curve. Extensive experiments show that beta calibration is 
superior to logistic calibration for naive Bayes and Adaboost.</p>
